\title{Caches next method in the calling environment}
\usage{
.cacheNextMethod()
}
\description{
If the calling environment does not have the next method to be invoked
in the inheritance chain cached yet, this will find the next method
(using \code{findNextMethod()}, and cache it in the calling environment such
that a subsequent call to \code{methods::callNextMethod()} will find and use
it.
}
\details{
As per the description, what this function does would normally already
be done by invoking \code{methods::callNextMethod()}, so in theory this should
be entirely redundant at best. However, \code{methods::addNextMethod()}, which
is invoked by \code{callNextMethod()} if a next method isn't cached yet, is
broken (errors out) if one of the classes in the signature name-clashes
with a class defined in another package. Calling this function prior to
\code{callNextMethod()} is meant to work around that.
